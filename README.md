# *** BASED SYNTHETIC DATA FOR NETWORK ***
In rapid devlovemet of 5G network,current research focuses on apply many AI/ML method to solve many complex problems.In 5G,network ****** plays very important role but due to lack of data the research in this domain is limited.To solve this problem we have used --- based model to genrate the synthetic data.
.---- can generativity mimic these --  slice data  from historical information.More data will  generate a global view of network slice resources requirements.
