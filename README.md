# GAN BASED SYNTHETIC DATA FOR NETWORK SLICING
In rapid devlovemet of 5G network,current research focuses on apply many AI/ML method to solve many complex problems.In 5G,network slicing plays very important role but due to lack of data the research in this domain is limited.To solve this problem we have used GAN based model to genrate the synthetic data.
GAN can generativity mimic these  data  from historical information.More data will  generate a global view of network  resources requirements.
